1) What is the maximum number of consecutive days a customer made 
purchases?
with ranked_transactions as (
 select
 cust_id,
 to_date(calendar_dt, 'YYYY-MM-DD') as calendar_dt,
 row_number() over (partition by cust_id order by
to_date(calendar_dt, 'YYYY-MM-DD')) as rn

2) On average, How many days/transactions does it take a customer to reach a 
spent threshold of 250 L.E?
with customer_cumulative_spending as (
 select

 select

 min(calendar_date) as threshold_date
 from
 customer_cumulative_spending
 where
 cumulative_spending >= 250
 group by
 cust_id
)
select
 floor(avg(days_to_threshold)) as average_days_to_threshold
from (
 select
 cust_id,
 avg(days_to_threshold) as days_to_threshold
 from (
 select
 ccs.cust_id,
 ccs.calendar_date,
 td.threshold_date,
 ccs.calendar_date - td.threshold_date as days_to_threshold
 from
 customer_cumulative_spending ccs
 join
 threshold_dates td on ccs.cust_id = td.cust_id
